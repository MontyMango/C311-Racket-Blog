# C311 Group 5: Create a Blog
## Project: Building a Simple Blog
Build a simple blogging application by following the tutorial “Continue: Web Applications in Racket”  (link below) 
Your application must implement first two features and at least one of remaining two features from the following features:
1) Show a static list of posts
2) Allow a user to add multiple new posts to the system.
3) Allow posts to be shared between two browser windows (Section 7)
4) Allow users to add comments to a post.
Those two features can be done by following the steps described in Sections 1-7 of the tutorial.
### Extra Credit (5pts): You can get 5pts as extra credits if you implement all four features.
## Requirements
Each team will write a Racket program as described in the assigned projects. Then write a PowerPoint presentation that covers the following:
1. Describe the structure of your program, like what main functions it has, and what each of those functions do.
2. Describe new things you have learned and used in your project. New things are techniques/knowledge that have not covered in class. The more new things you have learned from doing this project, the better.
On the day of team presentations, each team will have 25 minutes to demonstrate your program and give your presentation. You must submit both the program and the presentation by the Tuesday before
